This is a Gradle-based Kotlin project in which I have summarized what I know about RxJava 2, from
its basics to some advanced topics.

As of now this project consists of following packages:

- [Creation](https://github.com/MasoodFallahpoor/RxJava2Playground/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/ir/fallahpoor/rxjava2playground/_1creation): how to create Observables using `Observable.create()`, `Observable.from()`, etc.
- [Subscription](https://github.com/MasoodFallahpoor/RxJava2Playground/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/ir/fallahpoor/rxjava2playground/_2subscription): how to consume Observables using various subscription methods available
- [Operators](https://github.com/MasoodFallahpoor/RxJava2Playground/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/ir/fallahpoor/rxjava2playground/_3operators): how to take advantage of operators like `Observable.filter()`, `Observable.map()`,
`Observable.merge()`, etc. to manipulate Observables
- [Flow control](https://github.com/MasoodFallahpoor/RxJava2Playground/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/ir/fallahpoor/rxjava2playground/_4flowcontrol): how to control Observables that outperform their subscribers
- [Backpressure](https://github.com/MasoodFallahpoor/RxJava2Playground/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/ir/fallahpoor/rxjava2playground/_5backpressure): how to control Observables that outperform their subscribers (in a more advanced way)
- [Error Handling](https://github.com/MasoodFallahpoor/RxJava2Playground/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/ir/fallahpoor/rxjava2playground/_6errorhandling): how to deal with errors when consuming an Observable
- [Testing](https://github.com/MasoodFallahpoor/RxJava2Playground/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/ir/fallahpoor/rxjava2playground/_7testing): how to use `TestObserver` and `TestScheduler` for testing Observables
